# pushy
an http push server (one day)

### progress
pushy responds to all requests with a 404 header and a bit of json,
which is nice if you like that sort of thing.

### one of these days
I started writing pushy to:

* practice some TDD in C
* have a push server that would monitor my NAS and push updates to
   a browser.

...in that order.
