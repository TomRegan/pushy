# pushy
an http push server (one day)

### progress
pushy responds to all requests with a 404 header and a bit of json,
which is nice if you like that sort of thing.

### one of these days
I started writing pushy to
a) practice some TDD in C
b) have a push server that would monitor my NAS and push updates to
   a browser.
... in that order.
